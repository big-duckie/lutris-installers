## Ultimate Yahtzee

*A computer adaptation of the classic dice game Yahtzee. Players take turns throwing five dice and attempting to make scoring combinations (full house, straight). The elusive five of a kind is referred to as a Yahtzee (hence the game's name).*

*In addition to the standard game (solo, against the computer, and against other human players), Ultimate Yahtzee has four other variations including Battle Yahtzee (your roll can hurt the other player's roll) and Pyramid Yahtzee (uses four sided dice).*

### Installation
To install the game, run the following command:

```bash
lutris -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/big-duckie/lutris-installers/main/installers/yahtzee.yml
```

The install script will walk you through the process, and will provide links to the files it requires.

When the Ultimate Yahtzee setup launches, leave all settings at their defaults. Changing them will break this script.

### Notes
The CD is not required to play, however you will lose access to the CD Audio.

CD Audio requires Wine to use the `D:` drive for the CD. You must also be using an original CD, or a CUE/BIN file. ISO files only contain the data tracks, but not the audio tracks.
