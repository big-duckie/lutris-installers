## I Spy Treasure Hunt

*I Spy Treasure Hunt is the sixth title developed by Black Hammer Productions in the I Spy series of games from Scholastic. All of the games are based on books written and photographed by the team of Jean Marzollo and Walter Wick.*

*This episode takes you on a treasure-hunting tour of a small seaside town called Smuggler's Cove. You'll visit local businesses in town - the Treasure Chest store, the Museum, the Duck Pond Inn, the Boat Shop and the Ice Cream Store, as well as the train station, a lighthouse, an island, and more. As you solve puzzles, you learn more about the pirate history of Smuggler's Cove, and with every riddle area you solve you'll discover a torn piece of a treasure map. As you collect pieces, you can click on a wax-sealed paper icon in the top right of your screen - here you'll click and drag the ripped pieces to fit them together into a map for a treasure hunt.*

*All actions are point, click, or drag with the mouse - in some areas your cursor will change to suit the riddle, such as becoming a magnifying glass to identify small items in a display case, or becoming binoculars in order to search the town from the top of a tower. When you need to move an object, your cursor becomes a grasping hand. On each puzzle page you'll find a question mark to click for help, an ear icon to click if you want the riddle to be read aloud again (You can also click on the words to hear each individual item read aloud), and the always-handy back arrow.*

*There are three separate treasure hunts to play, with different riddles and different treasure maps; once you finish the game and choose to play again, I Spy will pick one at random for you.*
